<h2>Text to Speech with Arbitrary Voice</h2>
 
<h4>This is a text-to-speech project. We try to generate a speech based on an arbitrary voice sample and an input text, that makes the generated speech sounds like the voice sample   </h3>
<h4>Text for test : 'The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain.'</h4>
<h4>Reference Voice: a voice sample</h4>
<h4>Speaker: ID of the Speaker for the Reference Voice</h4> 
<h4>Method: to generate speech based on different methods</h4> 
<h4>Mean Opinion Score (MOS): is a measure used in the domain of Quality of Experience and telecommunications engineering, 
representing overall quality of the generate speech. (How close to the Reference Voice for the generated speech? Is the generated speech read clearly for the input text )</h4>
